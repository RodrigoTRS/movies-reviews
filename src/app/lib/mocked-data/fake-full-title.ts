However, amongst the players lie the ‘Traitors’, who meet in secret and decide who to eliminate from their fellow players known as ‘Faithfuls’. Whilst trying to avoid being eliminated, the Faithfuls must figure out who is a Traitor and vote them out to take the prize money for themselves. If a Traitor makes it to the end, they are in with a chance of taking home the cash prize. But there will be twists, turns, and surprises for the players.",
